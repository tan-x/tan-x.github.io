## About

This page uses various Bootstrap elements with a little personal stylizing including background linear gradients, a custom brand element in the navbar, :hover CSS styling, and a shrunken collapsed nav dropdown to prevent overlapping main elements.

It also includes a few small Javascript effects for things like hover animations that couldn't be accomplished via CSS, IntersectionObvserver for making elements appear on scroll, and CSS filter changes for a couple elements when they scroll off the viewport.

## Changes/Bugs to work out

My portfolio page does not include active links as I haven't retooled my css correctly to have the entire element work as an anchor, instead of just the text or image within.

The JS hover function doesn't seem to enact the transition CSS property on first hover, but works on/off afterwards.

Background IMG on mobile snaps when the navigation bar disappears from scrolling.

I would like to change the portfolio grid to change on a full desktop view and see if I like it more than its static layout.
